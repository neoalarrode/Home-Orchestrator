One Home Assistant add-on, several independent plugins you install only
if you need them — each with its own decision logic you can read end to
end, never an opaque solver or a black box. It started as a battery
planner (Energy); today it also covers climate control, adaptive
lighting, Tuya/TP-Link device integration without relying on the cloud,
and Starlink monitoring.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it does |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **Energy** | Adaptive charge/discharge for home batteries by electricity price, solar production and real consumption, plus deferrable loads (washer, dishwasher...) — details below. |
| 🌡️ **Climate** | Adaptive thermostats per zone, exposed as native HA `climate.*` entities (HomeKit/Matter included) — presence-based presets, 24h forecast, interactive thermostat card. |
| 💡 **Lighting** | Adaptive lighting: color and brightness follow the sun's real position (never a fixed hour), presence-based on/off, conditional rules per zone, manual control from the dashboard itself. |
| 🛰️ **Starlink** | Monitors your Starlink (throughput, latency, sky obstruction, alignment, power draw) — integrates the open-source [Dishylink](https://github.com/DaveyHert/dishylink) project as-is, with a local proxy to the dish. |
| 🔗 **Tuya** | LAN ingestion bridge for Tuya devices — consumed internally by Climate/Lighting and/or optionally exposed to HA over MQTT, no Tuya cloud dependency. |
| 🔗 **TP-Link** | Same as Tuya but for Kasa/Tapo, via `python-kasa` (the same library Home Assistant's own TP-Link integration uses). |

Install only what you use — each plugin downloads on demand from the
interface itself, checksum-verified against this same repository. Energy
is the only one with a dashboard meant to be the add-on's main app;
without it installed, the root shows a minimal catalog to pick what to
install.

## Energy, in detail

A Home Assistant add-on that plans and executes your home batteries'
charge/discharge every minute, live against your real installation.
No Node-RED, no EMHASS: a purpose-built, deterministic engine you can
read end to end, plus a web interface where you declare every battery,
price and sensor yourself — nothing comes preloaded or hidden.

## Why it exists

The usual solutions (EMHASS, generic linear programming) solve the
problem well but hide the logic behind parameters that are hard to
reason about and a solver that doesn't explain its decisions. Battery
Orchestrator does the opposite: a two-pass algorithm you can read in
full, where every hourly decision comes with its reason in plain text
("charging off-peak to cover the next peak period", "blocked: full and
solar surplus available"...).

## What it does

- **Plans** hour by hour by combining tariff (fixed peak/mid-peak/off-peak
  or dynamic PVPC), solar forecast (HA sensor or Forecast.Solar API) and
  real consumption reconstructed from your own installation's history —
  no opaque machine learning.
- **Shares the charge** across all your batteries proportionally to their
  real capacity, and lets each one self-manage while discharging (with
  the correct power limit in each case: max unless it's full and there's
  still sun, in which case 0W so it doesn't self-drain).
- **Respects your limits**: max/min SOC per battery, contracted power,
  energy reserve for the future peak period even if that means an
  emergency mid-peak charge.
- **Estimates each battery's real health** by observing how much energy
  it takes to move its SOC a large chunk, and comparing that against the
  capacity you declared — not a blind cycle counter.
- **Calculates real accumulated savings**, comparing what you've actually
  paid against what you would have paid without a battery, hour by hour.
- **Flags anomalous consumption**: if real consumption spikes well above
  what's expected and stays that way for several cycles, it's flagged in
  the interface and a Home Assistant notification is sent — always with
  the full detail visible, never just a bare alert.
- **Configurable priority**: savings (default), pure solar
  self-consumption (never charges from the grid), or battery longevity
  (never exceeds 90% SOC).
- **Deferrable loads**: washing machine, dishwasher, electric water
  heater... any appliance with a controllable switch/plug. You choose the
  frequency (one-off, daily, or several times a day, optionally limited to
  specific days of the week) and whether it can be interrupted mid-way or
  not; the app decides on its own the best time to run it — with solar
  surplus, or failing that the cheapest hour available — without
  triggering false anomalous-consumption alerts.
- **Live status**: SOC, solar and consumption refresh every 5 seconds
  reading straight from Home Assistant, without waiting for the next full
  optimization cycle.
- **Read-only panel (wallpanel)**: besides Ingress, its own port for
  pinning the panel on a wall-mounted tablet (WallPanel, Fully Kiosk...)
  without going through Home Assistant's login — no access to the
  configuration at all, blocked server-side too, not just hidden in the UI.
- **Everything configurable from the web UI**: batteries, tariff, solar
  panels, consumption sensor — nothing hardcoded except the base URL of
  the free Forecast.Solar API. Configuration is exportable/importable as
  a file, in case you reinstall the add-on.
- **Grafana dashboard autoconfigurator** (optional): if you have
  Grafana + VictoriaMetrics/Prometheus, keeps the example "Energía —
  Centro de Control" dashboard synced with your real configuration
  (declared solar arrays) — manual button or automatic trigger on config
  changes. See [Grafana dashboard in DOCS.en.md](DOCS.en.md#grafana-dashboard).

## Installation

1. In Home Assistant: **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on store → ⋮ →
   Repositories**, and add:
   ```
   https://github.com/neoalarrode/Home-Orchestrator
   ```
2. Find "Home Orchestrator" in the store, install it and start it.
3. Open it from the sidebar (it uses Ingress, no port is exposed) —
   starting with nothing installed yet shows a minimal catalog to pick
   which plugin(s) to add.

Step-by-step setup instructions (Energy) in [DOCS.en.md](DOCS.en.md).

## Project status

Actively used and developed — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Always
starts in simulation mode: you'll see exactly what the add-on would do
without touching your real batteries, until you trust its decisions.
